# Makerbot profiles for 3D printing

This is my attempt to be more organised about my experiments with Makerbot 3D printing profiles.  There are so many options that it makes sense to store them in github rather than changing tem each time and forgetting my settings.

Do as you wish with these, and if you discover anything useful or any other cool options, PLAs, ABSs, tips, etc. then please drop me a line at info@pixelist.info or http://pixelist.info where I blog about such things.

Best,
Evan Raskob AKA pixelpusher
